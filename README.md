ðŸ“Š Economic Insights on Nigeriaâ€™s Public Debt and Key Variables ðŸ“Š
In my recent analysis, I explored fluctuations in Nigeriaâ€™s domestic and external debt, total public debt, and economic ratios to oil and non-oil revenue, with a deep dive into historical data spanning several decades from CBNâ€™s Annual Statistical Bulletin. I meticulously gathered data on Nigeriaâ€™s external and domestic debt, GDP growth rates, and other macroeconomic indicators. Employing sophisticated econometric techniques, such as Vector Autoregression (VAR) and cointegration tests, we aimed to uncover long-term relationships and causal links between debt levels and economic performance.
